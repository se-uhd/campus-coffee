 * Immutable user domain model. Fields are validated in the API layer via the DTOs.
 *
 * The two password fields are deliberately asymmetric. [password] is the raw, plaintext password and is
 * only ever set on the way *in* (create/update); the domain hashes it via the `PasswordHasher` port and
 * never reads it back. [passwordHash] is the stored hash, populated when a user is *read* and never
 * serialized to a client. [roles] is the user's set of authorization roles.
