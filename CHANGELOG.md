# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

- Migrate the build from Maven to Gradle (Kotlin DSL): a `gradle/libs.versions.toml` version catalog and `build-logic` convention plugins (in the `de.seuhd.campuscoffee` package) replace the parent POM; the `coverage` module becomes a Gradle subproject using `jacoco-report-aggregation` with a `JacocoCoverageVerification` gate (90% line / 80% branch). Bump the JDK from 21 to 25, scope `spring-boot-starter-web` to `api`/`application`, build subprojects in parallel, and drop the redundant plain jar. Gradle is provisioned via `mise` (no wrapper); the `pom.xml` files and stale `target/` output are removed.
- Upgrade Spring Boot 3.5.8 to 4.0.6 (Spring Framework 7) and springdoc to 3.0.1. Drop Spring Cloud and migrate the OpenStreetMap client from `@FeignClient` to a Spring `@HttpExchange` declarative client over `RestClient`. Adjust for Boot 4: add the `spring-boot-flyway` autoconfiguration module, pin a single JUnit 6 via an enforced `junit-bom` (cucumber pulls JUnit Platform 1.x, which clashes with Spring 7), migrate the custom sequence generator to Hibernate 7's `GeneratorCreationContext` SPI (which again sets the sequence increment to 1 to match Flyway), and pin Testcontainers. Replace RestAssured with Spring 7's `RestTestClient` in the system and acceptance HTTP tests, removing RestAssured and its transitive Groovy dependency.
- Migrate the production code and the tests from Java to Kotlin, module by module (`domain` → `api` → `data` → `application`). The former records become `data class`es (domain models, DTOs, `ErrorResponse`) with named arguments and `copy()` in place of Lombok builders; the JPA entities use the `kotlin-jpa` (no-arg/all-open) plugin; and the MapStruct mappers run via `kapt`, preserving `HouseNumberConverter` and the `@Mapping(expression=...)` logic. `TestFixtures`, the `GlobalExceptionHandler`, the OpenAPI customizers, the sequence generators, and every test are Kotlin too. Add `kotlin-conventions` (Kotlin 2.3.21, `jvmTarget` 25, the Spring all-open plugin, `kotlin-reflect`), `kotlin-jpa-conventions`, and `kotlin-kapt-conventions` convention plugins, and generate Spring configuration metadata for `@ConfigurationProperties` via `kapt`. Remove Lombok entirely (and the JSpecify nullability annotations), since Kotlin's nullable types express nullability natively. DTOs deserialize via `jackson-module-kotlin`; the Mockito tests use `mockito-kotlin`.
- Containerize and deploy to Google Cloud Run: the `Dockerfile` builds the app with Gradle and copies the JAR, `compose.yaml` works with Google Cloud Build and Cloud Run, `mise.toml` adds the Google Cloud dependencies, and `README.md` documents the deployment.
- Add JaCoCo code coverage via a new `coverage` module that aggregates execution data across modules (so the integration and system tests in `application` count toward `domain`/`api`/`data`), and enforce a line/branch gate during `gradle build` and in CI, uploading the reports as an artifact. Add opt-in PITest mutation testing (`gradle :<module>:pitest -Pmutation`): each module mutates its own classes, and `application` additionally mutates `api`/`data` against the system and acceptance tests (generated `*MapperImpl` classes excluded). Strengthen the unit tests using surviving mutants as a worklist.
- Tidy Kotlin idioms and enforce style: add ktlint, gated via `check` and configured by a root `.editorconfig` (with `.gitattributes` normalizing line endings to LF); return the immutable fixtures directly (dropping `commons-lang3` and `Serializable`), replace `java.util.Optional` with native nullables (`findByIdOrNull`), and add an `Identifiable.persistedId` accessor; drop `@JvmStatic` left over from Java interop; convert the Cucumber glue to constructor injection; and adopt backtick test-method names with a consistent structure (documented in `CLAUDE.md`), using the reified `returnResult<T>()` in the system tests.
- Add detekt `2.0.0-alpha.3` for Kotlin static analysis, applied through the `kotlin-conventions` convention plugin and gated via `check` (the build fails on new findings). A per-module `detekt-baseline.xml` grandfathers the remaining findings (3, in the `data` exception-mapping code); a swallowed-exception finding it surfaced is fixed by chaining the optimistic-lock cause into `ConcurrentUpdateException`. detekt requires the exact Kotlin version it was built against, so Kotlin is pinned at 2.3.21; the stable detekt 1.x line does not support Kotlin 2.3.
- Tighten the web layer: centralize the `/api` base path in an `ApiPathConfig` `WebMvcConfigurer`; make `GlobalExceptionHandler` extend `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` so standard Spring MVC exceptions map to their correct status codes (unknown path → 404, wrong method → 405, unsupported/unacceptable media type → 415/406, missing parameter → 400) instead of 500; and serve the API as JSON only by dropping the XML converter (via Spring 7's `HttpMessageConverters` builder; OSM parsing keeps its own `XmlMapper`). Bind `osm.api.base-url` through an `OsmApiProperties` `@ConfigurationProperties` class (which generates configuration metadata) rather than `@Value`.
- Replace the automatic data load on startup with on-demand, dev-only endpoints on `DevController` (`GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/dev/data`, registered only in the `dev` profile; `PUT` clears and reseeds idempotently). The application no longer seeds data on startup in any profile, and the database persists across restarts. Removes `LoadInitialData`.
